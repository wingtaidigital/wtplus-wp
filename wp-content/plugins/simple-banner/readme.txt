Display a simple banner/bar at the top of your website.

== Description ==

This plugin makes it easy to display a simple announcement banner or bar at the top of your website. You can easily customize the color of the links, text, and background of the bar from within the settings. You can also customize to your heart's desire by adding your own custom CSS. There's also a fancy preview section within the settings so you can see your changes before you save them.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does the banner look like in my DOM? =

This is how the banner will look in your HTML:

`<code>
    <div id="simple-banner" class="simple-banner">
      <div class="simple-banner-text">
        <span>
          YOUR SIMPLE BANNER TEXT HERE
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
</code>
`

= The banner or changes to the banner aren't showing up, or are only showing up when I'm logged in, what's wrong? =

Your browser frequently caches scripts associated with a website in order to improve speed and performance. There are also some
wordpress plugins that cache scripts to improve performance. If you aren't seeing your banner or the changes you made to the banner,
first clear your browser cache and if that doesn't work, look for any plugin that bundles or caches scripts and clear that as well.

= Why is my banner covering my header or behind my header? =

Your theme probably uses absolute positioning for its header in this case. Try changing the positioning of your banner and see if that helps.
This changes the <code>position</code> CSS attribute of the banner. More information can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_position.asp">here</a>. If none of this works, you may need a custom solution for your banner.
You can either try to find another plugin that suits your needs or you can purchase the pro version and open a support ticket to fix your situation.

= My homepage isn't disabled even though I set it as disabled. =

Some themes use a page id of 1 for the homepage, other themes set that id dynamically. This has recently been fixed, but if you are still
experiencing issues, please open a support ticket.
In the meantime you can use the following custom JavaScript to disable on your homepage:

`document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function(){
  if (window.location.href === "YOUR_WEBSITE_URL_HERE"){
    document.getElementById('simple-banner').remove();
  }
}, false);
`

= Is there a Pro version? =

Yes, but you should look through the support topics before you decide if you need the pro version.

= Does this plugin use cookies? =

Yes, they are used only if you enable the close button. These cookies fall under the category of "strictly necessary cookies" and do not need consent from the user, more information <a target="_blank" href="https://gdpr.eu/cookies/">here</a>. 
If cookies are disabled on the user's browser, the banners close button expiration setting will not work and the banner will show on each refresh.

= How do I re-enable my banner after I hit the close button =

You can clear your browser's cookies or in the browser's console you can execute:

`document.cookie = "simplebannerclosed=; expires=Thu, 18 Dec 2013 12:00:00 UTC; path=/";
`

= How do I disable the banner in my posts? =

This feature is being actively developed, in the meantime you can use this custom JavaScript:

`document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function(){
  if (window.location.pathname.includes("post")){
    document.getElementById('simple-banner').remove();
  }
}, false);
`
= I have the Divi theme and the banner isn't showing. =

Set your banner position to <code>relative</code> and try this in 'Website Custom CSS':

`#main-header:not(.et-fixed-header) {
  position: relative;
}`
`#top-header:not(.et-fixed-header) {
  position: relative;
}`
